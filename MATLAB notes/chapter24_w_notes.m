Spike sorting notes are found in "Mathematics of Action Potential and Spike
Trains".

First, we will test to see whether if we can seperate signals of spikes
from different groups of neurons by amplitude and widths of the spikes:
We will define spike amplitude as the distance between the peak of the
spike waveform and the preceding dip. And we will define spike width as
the distance in time between the pre-peak dip and the post-peak dip.

spikefeat = zeros(size(spikes, 1), 2);

for spikei=1:size(spikes,1)
    
    % find peak
    [~,peakidx] = max(spikes(spikei,:));
    
    % find minimum before peak
    [~,min1idx] = min(spikes(spikei,1:peakidx));
    
    % find minimum after peak
    [~,min2idx] = min(spikes(spikei, peakidx:end));
    min2idx = min2idx+peakidx-1;
    
    % get premin-peak difference
    spikefeat(spikei,1) = diff( spikes(spikei,[min1idx peakidx]) );
    
    % get min2min
    spikefeat(spikei,2) = min2idx-min1idx;
end

Now letfs see if these two features can differentiate different neurons. We
will make a plot of one feature versus the other feature (spike amplitude vs.
spike width), with each dot reflecting one action potential. If all action
potentials come from one neuron, there will be little spatial structure in the
plot. However, if the action potentials recorded by this electrode come from
two different neurons, there will be separable clouds of dots, with each
cloud corresponding to each neuron.

h = plot(spikefeat(:,1),spikefeat(:,2),'ko','markerfacecolor','k');

set(h,'markeredgecolor',[.7 .7 .7])
xlabel('Spike amplitude')
ylabel('Spike width')

%{
Discussion about the results:
The resulting plot do not allow us to distinguish between two neuron
populations and which signal was attributed to each type. There are two
possibilities for why this is:
1. All the spikes in this dataset comes from one group of neurons. 
2. Spike amplitude and widths are terrible parameters for distinguishing
between two populations of neuron groups. 
%}

%% now with PCA
%{
Amplitude and width alone are insufficient to isolate two neuron datasets.
We can apply PCA to waveforms and inspect whether the projection of each
spike onto principal component (PC) space can differentiate two neuron
sets.

PCA involves eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix.
%}
% subtract mean
spikes = bsxfun(@minus, spikes, mean(spikes, 2));

% covariance matrix
spikecov = spikes'*spikes / (size(spikes, 1) - 1);     % Here if we put A'*A, we are taking the dot product, which results in square matrix of each column of A column x A column, rather than square matrix of size A row x A row (which is the case for A*A')
%{
(spikes, 1) is passing the argument 1 as the second input to the mean function, 
which specifies the dimension along which the mean is calculated. In this case, 
1 indicates that the mean should be calculated across the rows (i.e., for each time 
point across all spikes).

(size(spikes, 1) - 1) calculates the degrees of freedom for the sample covariance matrix calculation. 
The sample covariance matrix is an estimate of the true covariance matrix of the population, calculated 
using a finite number of samples. The degrees of freedom represent the number of independent observations
in the sample that are used to estimate the covariance. In this case, subtracting 1 from the number of samples 
ensures that the sample covariance matrix is an unbiased estimator of the true covariance matrix.
